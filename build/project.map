......
WARNING:Place:1109 - A clock IOB / BUFGMUX clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGMUX site pair. The clock
   IOB component <rclk> is placed at site <P102>. The corresponding BUFG
   component <rclk_IBUF_BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGMUX_X2Y10>. There is only a
   select set of IOBs that can use the fast path to the Clocker buffer, and they
   are not being used. You may want to analyze why this problem exists and
   correct it. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE
   constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <rclk.PAD> allowing your design to
   continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules related to the
   specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may
   lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition
   be corrected in the design.

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2212 - Async clocking for BRAM (comp fifo/Mram_f)
   port(s) with READ_FIRST mode has certain restrictions. Make sure that there
   is no address collision. A read/write on one port and a write operation from
   the other port at the same address is not allowed.RAMB8BWER in all
   configurations, A12-6 including A4 cannot be the same. Violating this
   restriction may result in the incorrect operation of the BRAM.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2410 - This design is using one or more 9K Block RAMs
   (RAMB8BWER).  9K Block RAM initialization data, both user defined and
   default, may be incorrect and should not be used.  For more information,
   please reference Xilinx Answer Record 39999.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
